## UX

### User Stories

As an employer I expect to see a showcase of Stephen's work.

As a recruiter I expect to see a showcase of Stephen's cv.


### Strategy

The goal in the design process was to make it as easy as possible to access relevant information on the application while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design.

### Scope
For employers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of myself and my capabilites. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who I am, my background, work I have done, and my skill, with an option to contact me if they choose.

### Structure
In the 'work' section, I wanted viewers to be abble to quickly access work that I have done, providing a quick snippet summary of the project with a link to a Github repository and live link.
I have also included social links which is situated on a fade-in bar to keep a clean main navbar / footer.

### Surface
The grey colours complimented with white and black and some orange on hover and nav items.

### Features left to Implement
In the future, I would like to have this application as scalable as possible and this was the main reason for using django framework, although it does not implement a lot of the django features early on, I plan on adding a blog section. A contact section which does not just us mailto:, I also plan on creating a file explorer which will hold all project code all in one place which will use the github api. I have also considered using django as an api holder and reactjs as the front end which would be a nice combination of both technologies.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using heroku, with packages django-heroku and whitenoise for image hosting, I was toying with using AWS s3 but because there was so few images to host I decided to go with whitenoise as it made more sense, for future releases and scalability I will transition to AWS as it would make more sense.
